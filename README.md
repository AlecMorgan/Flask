# Flask
A simple interactive toy website that utilizes Flask to implement interactive features via the Python ecosystem. This is just a small project I undertook in order to learn Flask as a suplement to my skills in data science. 

The final stage of CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Practice for Data Mining) is model deployment, which could just mean using a fully trained and cross-validated ML model in a Jupyter Notebook to the end of performing data analyses and presenting the results. However, in many situations it would be far more useful to expose the finished model to employees as a tool that can provide up-to-date insights on changing data *or* to make better product and service recommendations to customers. In either of these cases, a web application is the logical way to deploy a model.

Flask (or Django) are critical for this since they let Python and its entire ML ecosystem play with web languages such as Javascript. Javascript and React can be used to make a button appear and make it clickable, and as soon as that button is pressed a sophisticated ML model can go to work.
